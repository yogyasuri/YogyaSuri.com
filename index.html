    <p>Questioner (Q): How to know whether a decision is right or wrong? What is
        right for one is wrong for the other. Nature has given everyone the right to
        choose. Who are we to criticize the decisions of others?
        Acharya Prashant (AP): Right or wrong are not decided in the context of
        others. You’re right, nobody has the right to label a person or a person’s
        decision-making as right or wrong. However, it does not mean that there is
        nothing called a right decision or a wrong decision.
        Understand it simply. What is it that we all fundamentally want?
        We want peace.
        We want relaxation.
        We don’t want to be tense.
        We want contentment.
        Ever seen anyone who enjoys being dissatisfied or diminished or hurt or
        angry? What is it that we all want? What is the common, universal need among
        humans? Peace and contentment. Nobody wants to be sad. We want a subtle
        joyful state of consciousness, and we all want that irrespective of the country we
        come from, irrespective of our age, our gender, our religion, our ethnicity.
        Nobody wants to be sad. Nobody wants to feel hurt.
        So, if that is our core need, then you should know when to call a decision right
        and when to call one wrong.
        If your decisions lead to peace, joy, and contentment for you, then they are
        right. Otherwise, they are wrong.
        And this decision regarding a choice being right or wrong obviously is not
        coming from others; it is about your own inner self. What is the impact of your
        choices on your life? That is what you must look at. Are your choices making
        you more insecure, anxious, jealous, unsettled, restless? Then it would be
        dishonest to call these as right choices for you. And it is not in a relative sense; it
        is not as if one choice that is right for this person will be right for the other one
        also.
        However, as we cautioned earlier, it doesn’t mean that any choice is all right.
        There is definitely something called a right choice and there is definitely
        something called a wrong choice, and you have to be very careful because
        choices determine your life.
        Next, you have mentioned that nature has given everyone the right to decide.
        Yes, that is true, and equally nature has given everyone the right to decide
        foolishly. Remember that it is just a right. A right is an option: you may choose
        to exercise it, or you may choose not to.
        Unfortunately, most people do not choose to exercise this option wisely. What
        is the option all about? The option is: you could choose either from your heartful
        intelligence, or you could choose and decide from your conditioned self.
        Choosing, deciding, acting from your conditioned self is apparently easy
        because it hardly requires any effort. Therefore, most people allow their life,
        actions, thoughts, decisions, everything to come from their conditioned centres.
        It feels comfortable.
        But then, the option to operate from the centre of heartful intelligence is
        available. That is what brings joy and contentment to you. That is what brings
        liberation to you. But that option is scarcely chosen because there is a price to
        pay, and few people want to pay that price. We are lazy and stingy. We don’t
        want to work hard enough; we want to avoid exertion. We don’t want to pay the
        price, so we don’t go for the right option.
        When you say that nature has given everyone the right to choose, remember
        that the right is often not exercised wisely.
        It is upon you to make good use of the right, the power vested in you.
        You could choose either from your heartful intelligence, or you could choose
        and decide from your conditioned self.</p>
